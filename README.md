# StarterMockHttp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Description

This is a template designed to provide a quick starting point to prototype more quickly without a backend with the intention of eventually replacing the backend with http requests to a server. To modify the starting object, look under src/http-obj.service.ts.
